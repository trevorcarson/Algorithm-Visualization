# Algorithm-Visualization
A 2D visualization of the runtime associated with algorithms.
Files:
- Randomize: Creates a randomized list with values 1 to N. This list will be visually displayed as it gets sorted
- Sort: Sorting algoritm. Three algorithms where implemented: Insertion, Selection, and Bubble. Heap and Merge Sort where also implemented, but I could not find a good way of making it visually appealing.
- Graphing: Uses std.draw to make bar graphs which are sorted according to whichever algorithm is being used.
All three of these programs used Integer.parseInt() to pipe the provided outcome of each program to the next.
